(1) Short game description: Save the humans by constructing a helping barrier! Use and improve your construction and engineering skills.
Draw beams by dragging your mouse from joint to joint...and when you're finished, test your construction by hitting the "Run" button!
For each level, you are challenged with a maximum amount of beams you can use for your construction - but no worries, we also included an "Undo" button and you can always go back into the construction mode with the "Construct" button, if something went wrong during the test run. We hope you enjoy our game, happy constructing! :-)
