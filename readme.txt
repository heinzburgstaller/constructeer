(1) Our game is based on the interactive construction of objects: the user has to construct a building with building blocks made out of different materials. This building has then to withstand a test with simulated natural forces acting on the building. Each level is set in a different geographical region with different challenges (typically occurring in this region) that have to be passed as tests in order to pass to the next level; for example withstanding heavy snowfall in Russia, fire and heat in Spain, earthquakes in Mexico, or bombs in Syria. The game is supposed to convey the fundamentals of statics in a playful way and also addresses non-engineering students, who can playfully adapt the engineering mindset through the task of constructing a building and finding out what makes it stable and well-built with the “learning by doing” approach.
