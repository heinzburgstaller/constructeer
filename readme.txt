(1) Our game is based on the interactive construction of objects: the user has to construct a building with building blocks made out of different materials. This building has then to withstand a test with simulated natural or artificial forces (such as snow, stones, rockets) acting on the building. Each level contains humans placed on a colorful background. These humans ought to be protected from the forces by constructing a suitable building for them. In order to successfully complete a level, it is necessary that neither human being is damaged by the forces. The game is supposed to convey the fundamentals of statics in a playful way and also addresses non-engineering students, who can playfully adapt the engineering mindset through the task of constructing a building and finding out what makes it stable and well-built with the “learning by doing” approach.
